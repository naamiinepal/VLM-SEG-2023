class UNetPP(smp.UnetPlusPlus):
    r"""Unet++ is a fully convolution neural network for image semantic segmentation. Consist of *encoder*
    and *decoder* parts connected with *skip connections*. Encoder extract features of different spatial
    resolution (skip connections) which are used by decoder to define accurate segmentation mask. Decoder of
    Unet++ is more complex than in usual Unet.

    Args:
        encoder_name: Name of the classification model that will be used as an encoder (a.k.a backbone)
            to extract features of different spatial resolution
        encoder_depth: A number of stages used in encoder in range [3, 5]. Each stage generate features
            two times smaller in spatial dimensions than previous one (e.g. for depth 0 we will have features
            with shapes [(N, C, H, W),], for depth 1 - [(N, C, H, W), (N, C, H // 2, W // 2)] and so on).
            Default is 5
        encoder_weights: One of **None** (random initialization), **"imagenet"** (pre-training on ImageNet) and
            other pretrained weights (see table with available weights for each encoder_name)
        decoder_channels: List of integers which specify **in_channels** parameter for convolutions used in decoder.
            Length of the list should be the same as **encoder_depth**
        decoder_use_batchnorm: If **True**, BatchNorm2d layer between Conv2D and Activation layers
            is used. If **"inplace"** InplaceABN will be used, allows to decrease memory consumption.
            Available options are **True, False, "inplace"**
        decoder_attention_type: Attention module used in decoder of the model.
            Available options are **None** and **scse** (https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08127).
        in_channels: A number of input channels for the model, default is 3 (RGB images)
        classes: A number of classes for output mask (or you can think as a number of channels of output mask)
        activation: An activation function to apply after the final convolution layer.
            Available options are **"sigmoid"**, **"softmax"**, **"logsoftmax"**, **"tanh"**, **"identity"**,
                **callable** and **None**.
            Default is **None**
        aux_params: Dictionary with parameters of the auxiliary output (classification head). Auxiliary output is build
            on top of encoder if **aux_params** is not **None** (default). Supported params:
                - classes (int): A number of classes
                - pooling (str): One of "max", "avg". Default is "avg"
                - dropout (float): Dropout factor in [0, 1)
                - activation (str): An activation function to apply "sigmoid"/"softmax"
                    (could be **None** to return logits)

    Returns:
        ``torch.nn.Module``: **Unet++**
